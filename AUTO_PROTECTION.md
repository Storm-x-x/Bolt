- Restores protection elements if they're removed

### 3. Network Monitoring

- Monitors network requests to detect unauthorized API usage
- Adds copyright headers to outgoing requests
- Tracks suspicious API calls
- Helps identify data exfiltration attempts

### 4. Periodic Checks

## How It Works

The automatic protection system is loaded when the application starts and runs continuously in the background. It doesn't require any user intervention and will automatically:

1. Add copyright fingerprints to the application
2. Monitor for tampering attempts
3. Display warnings for unauthorized use
4. Run periodic scans for code theft
5. Generate reports and takedown notices
