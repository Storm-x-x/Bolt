## How to Recover Stolen Code

If you discover that your code has been stolen or used without permission, follow these steps to recover your intellectual property:

### 1. Document Evidence

Before taking action, gather evidence of your ownership:

- **Git commit history**: Use `git log` to show your commit history with timestamps
- **Screenshots**: Take screenshots of both the infringing content and your original work
- **Development records**: Collect any documentation, emails, or other records showing your development process

### 2. Use the DMCA Takedown Generator

This repository includes a built-in DMCA takedown notice generator:

1. Navigate to `/dmca` in your application
2. Enter the URLs of both the infringing content and your original work
3. Generate the appropriate DMCA notice
4. Follow the provided instructions to submit the notice

### 3. Contact GitHub Support

For repositories hosted on GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub's DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca)
2. Submit the GitHub-specific DMCA notice generated by the tool
3. Include links to both the infringing repository and your original repository
4. Provide any additional evidence of your ownership

### 4. Legal Action

If the above steps don't resolve the issue:

1. Consult with an intellectual property attorney
2. Send a formal cease and desist letter
3. Consider filing a copyright infringement lawsuit if necessary

### 5. Prevent Future Theft

This repository includes several protection measures:

- **Code ownership validation**: Detects unauthorized use
- **Copyright watermarks**: Makes ownership clear
